# Power_BI_Reports
Collection of Different Power BI Reports

This repository contains a collection of different reports written using Microsoft Power BI.

## Education Loan
This report contains two sheets. The first one has data on a list of 50 different universities (private and public) with information on their tuitions.
In addition, there is data on 20 different majors and the average entry level salary after a four year undergraduate degree from each major. Therefore, 
the report allows someone to compare entry level salaries to the tuition cost of the university.

The second sheet contains an interaction in which one can calculate their Monthly Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) based on their principal, interest rate, and
the amount of time to pay a loan (in months), in addition to the total amount paid including interest.

The purpose of this report is to show a prospective undergraduate student the cost of going to university, the salaries of poeple of different majors, and the 
logistics with regards to taking a student loan. This report would show the most amount of money you can spend per month paying off a loan given your major. 
Therefore, this report would help students as you can filter universities based on their tuition cost as well as filter majors based on their entry level salaries.
This could potentially help prospective undergraduate students be financially aware of going to college and not get into crippling debt.
